The melodies of the flute make the maidens dance,
The eyes set out to play Holi with Shyam in a trance.
In the streets of Barsana, joy spreads so bright,
To play Holi with Shyam,[] arrives in delight!

Sometimes with gulal, sometimes with showers of hue,
Kanha teases all, hidden from view.
Smiling with the Gopis, [] sways,
Drenched in colors, she comes to play!
